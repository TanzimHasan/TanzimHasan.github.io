    </h4>
    <h6>     This game seemed to be a resting period for the main producers of the team; Capela and Westbrook both sat this game out, allowing Jeff Green and PJ Tucker to start in their place. It is clear that Houston was not concerned for this matchup. This eventually led to one of the ugliest wins of the season. Led by Harden, abysmal shooting at 2-18 from 3 (which is an  absolutely ridiculous 11.1%), the team had one of their worst shooting nights in history, going for a combined 35-98 from ther field. The Hornets were on their A-Game, taking an early lead in the 1st and 2nd, with a fastbreak offense spearheaded by Devontae Graham. It wasn&#39;t until late in the third that the Rockets eventually began to pick up the pace (and actually stop shooting the ball so much). </h6>
    <h6>     While Harden shot poorly, he expertly drew as many fouls as humanely possible, going to the freethrow line a total of thirteen times and shooting 22-25 of his free throws. It was this craftiness that let him score 40 that night, as well as seal the game for the Rockets. Hopefully they pick it up. Side note, PJ Tucker was defensively very good tonigh, holding his opponents to only 23% shooting and managing 4 blocks and 6 steals. At only 6&#39;5, he is menacing at the center position. </h6>
