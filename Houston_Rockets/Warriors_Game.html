    </h4>
    <h6>     The final game of the previous Rocket Lineup was disasterous, at best. The lineup was forsaken to fail with PJ Tucker suffering from a keen injury from a previous game and Harden being on a minutes restriction. The majority of the Rocket&#39;s offense depened on Russsell Westbrook. While he did score 46 of the Rocket&#39;s 104 points, he did so by shooting an abysmal 17 of 43 attempts, as well as going 2 of 9 from beyond the arc. His poor shot selection and questionale jumper continues to be a rising issue as the season progresses, especially in a system so dependendent on shooting as Mike D&#39;Antoni&#39;s. The ball was in Westbrook&#39;s hands for most of the night, ultimately limiting the offensive capabilites and oppurtunities of the remaining roster. </h6>
    <h6>     Defense is also a large issue as seen in the game last night. The Rockets had no answer for Marquisse Chriss in the paint and Stephen Curry from beyond the arc. Their lazy swat at the ball defense allowed Golden State to puncture very early in the 2nd quarter and develop a sizeable lead the the Rockets were ultimately unable to surmount. Fortunately, the Rockets seemed to turn it up at the end with Westbrook focusing less on shooting the bal and more on attacking the rim, which is his specialty. He lead a late charge in the 4th quarter where the Rockets outscored the Dubs 28-12. While it was a valiant try, it wasn&#39;t enough to match the elite shooting of Golden State. An exciting game, but ultimately disappointing. </h6>
